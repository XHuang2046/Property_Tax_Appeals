# Property_Tax_Appeals
Modeling for Cook County Property Tax Appeals Assessment

### Understanding of background
Appeals are built into the property tax system in Cook County: after the assessment, property owners can appeal, and they stand a chance of having their assessment revised. 
This is not uncommon--most property tax systems have an appeals process built in. 
In Cook County, though, the inaccuracies of those intial assessments has led to a multimillion dollar industry around tax appeals.

In this project, 2 questions will be considered. 
The first question is whether the appeals system introduces opportunities unfairness, as some have asserted. 
What are the factors that lead a property owner to appeal? To what extent do factors like race or median income play a part?  

The second question is what factors affect the monetary rewards of appealing. What influences how much money one might gain from a successful appeal?  
You will use a bigger, more enriched dataset in this project. It's attached below, along with the data dictionary. Note that this is a group project!
